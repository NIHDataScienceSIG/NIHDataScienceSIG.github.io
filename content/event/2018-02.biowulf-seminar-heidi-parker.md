In this Data Science Double Header, PacBio's Steve Turner will speak about resolving structural variants, then NHGRI's Heidi Parker will speak about assembling dog genomes on biowulf!

The Biowulf seminar series continues with talks by Biowulf users. The
first such seminar features Heidi Parker, the Senior Staff Scientist
for the Dog Genome Project at NHGRI.
